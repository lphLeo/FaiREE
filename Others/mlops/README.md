# MLOps

This directory will contain samples and examples to show how to leverage AIF360 for MLOps, in Machine Learning Platforms.

The will contain designs, specifications, shared code and processes that meet the following goals:
* Enable integration between MLOps Pipelines and AIF360 e.g. Kubeflow Pipelines working with AIF360
* Enable AIF360 to be surfaced in ML Platforms e.g. OpenScale, KFServing
* Enable support structure for this code to be maintained and tested
